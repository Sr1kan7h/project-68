        <p>Our School


            We are committed to improving the quality of the educational provision for all our children which will
            enable them to reach their full potential and attain the levels of knowledge, understanding and skills that
            society demands for their future lives. High quality education at Snapethorpe Primary School will be
            achieved by:

            positive, caring and clearly focused leadership from the senior leadership team

            the whole staff team working together to do its best for our children’s confidence

            the whole staff team having high expectations of our children’s social, behavioural and academic performance

            well planned, exciting and challenging teaching that develops lively, enquiring and open minds in our
            children

            creating stimulating and attractive learning environments in which our children can take a pride

            fostering a calm, secure and purposeful working atmosphere that nurtures a positive esteem and self image in
            all our children

            promoting respect for other people and their property

            working in partnership with parents, governors and the local community to enrich opportunities for our
            children



            We will continually strive to achieve the school’s aims through the formal curriculum and through all the
            other experiences offered to our children. High quality education will raise the children’s standards of
            attainment, enabling them to:

            develop their use of English and Maths which provide the foundation for all their other learning

            learn social skills that encourage agreeable interactions between their peers as well as adults

            treat everyone in an equal manner, irrespective of gender, race, class or disability

            develop personal and moral values that are respectful of others, leading to their appreciation and
            toleration of other religions and other ways of life

            learn in a safe and secure environment, in keeping with Health and Safety Regulations that are in the
            interests of all whom work in the school.</p>

        History
        Our history curriculum develops a coherent knowledge and understanding of Britain’s past and that of the wider
        world. It inspires pupils’ curiosity to know more about the past. Teaching should equip pupils to ask perceptive
        questions, think critically, weigh evidence, sift arguments, and develop perspective and judgement. History
        helps pupils to understand the complexity of people’s lives, the process of change, the diversity of societies
        and relationships between different groups, as well as their own identity and the challenges of their time.
        Children develop skills such as chronological understanding, evaluating evidence and comparing life in the
        different periods.

        At Snapethorpe, history is taught within our ‘Creative’ Curriculum using the national curriculum objectives in
        chronological order. As a school, we have ensured each area of focus is broken down into year group specific
        expectations allowing the children to develop new knowledge and skills and then build on these as they progress
        through the year groups.

        Children’s historical learning in key stage one starts with the familiar: toys and changes within living memory.
        As children’s learning travels further back in time, they learn about a key individual from the local area,
        Charles Waterton. Their learning about Charles Waterton is enhanced with a trip to the Charles Waterton Museum.
        In Year 2, children compare their own lives to that of children in the past. Their historical learning also
        moves further afield to Kenya, learning about a key individual outside of the UK, Wangari Maathai.

        In key stage two, children learn the history of Britain in chronological order, as well as studying ancient
        civilisations and local history. Children start by learning about prehistoric Britain in Year 3, Roman Britain
        in Year 4, the Anglo Saxon and Viking invasion of Britain in Year 5 and concluding with British history beyond
        1066 in Year 6. This study is complemented with a local history unit about coal mining, including a trip to the
        National Coal Mining Museum and studies of the ancient civilisations of the Egyptians, Greeks and Benin.
        Children express their learning in a variety of ways, including writing, discussion, drama and art.

        Throughout the History units planned and taught for at Snapethorpe, other subjects are also woven through where
        appropriate such as art and design, design and technology, cooking and nutrition and computing. Within the
        history units, we try and provide the children with visits and visitors to allow their knowledge and skills to
        be extended. These visit and visitors are sometimes used to hook the children into their theme, during the theme
        to develop knowledge or at the end of the theme apply their knowledge. The topics children study offer scope to
        also use a variety of historical resources which are held within school or accessed from local historical
        providers. Key technical vocabulary is identified for each unit, allowing children to build a rich bank of
        historical language.
